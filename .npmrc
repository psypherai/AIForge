# Required for Expo / React Native compatibility.
# Metro bundler resolves modules by walking the filesystem and cannot
# follow pnpm's symlinked .pnpm store structure. node-linker=hoisted
# creates a flat node_modules (like npm/yarn) while keeping pnpm's
# speed, lockfile, and workspace benefits.
# This is the official Expo recommendation for pnpm monorepos.
